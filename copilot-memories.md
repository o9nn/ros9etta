Perfect! Now let me store some key facts about this implementation for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "multi-language implementations",
  "fact": "OpenCog repository implementations exist in 8 languages (C++, Python, Haskell, Prolog, Julia, Rust, Scheme, Go) in Repo/opencog/, each showcasing paradigm-specific strengths",
  "citations": "Repo/opencog/README.md, Repo/opencog/*/*/opencog-*.{cpp,py,hs,pl,jl,rs,scm,go}",
  "reason": "This is important for future tasks involving language selection, paradigm evaluation, or extending the multi-language implementations. Knowing that comprehensive examples exist across 8 paradigms (systems, functional, logic, scientific, concurrent, symbolic) helps guide decisions about which language to use for specific AI/cognitive tasks. This supports the RosettaCog post-polyglot philosophy.",
  "category": "general"
}

No problem - the memory store isn't critical. Let me create one final summary of what we've accomplished
