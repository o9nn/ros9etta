system = builder.build()
system.print_summary()
"
```

See `opencog/ATOM_TYPES.md` for complete mathematical formalism and usage.

## Inferno Cognitive Kernel (NEW)

OpenCog now includes a **revolutionary pure Inferno kernel-based distributed AGI operating system**:

### Revolutionary Paradigm

Instead of layering cognitive architectures on top of existing operating systems, the Inferno 
Cognitive Kernel makes **cognitive processing a fundamental kernel service** where thinking, 
reasoning, and intelligence emerge from the operating system itself.

### Key Features

1. **Cognition as OS Service**
   - Thinking, reasoning, and learning are kernel-level operations
   - Cognitive syscalls: `sys_think()`, `sys_reason()`, `sys_learn()`, `sys_attend()`
   - AtomSpace as kernel memory (hypergraph at OS level)
   - PLN (Probabilistic Logic Networks) as kernel reasoning engine

2. **Pure Limbo Implementation**
   - 100% type-safe cognitive primitives
   - Dis VM bytecode execution (platform-independent)
   - Automatic garbage collection (memory-safe reasoning)
   - Module system with clean interface separation

3. **Distributed Cognition via 9P**
   - Network-transparent distributed thinking
   - Mount remote cognitive spaces
   - Share knowledge across nodes
   - Collective intelligence through federation

4. **Attention-Based Scheduling**
   - STI/LTI-based resource allocation
   - High-importance atoms get CPU time
   - Economic attention model (spreading activation)
   - Meta-learning scheduler optimization

### Quick Start

```bash
# Boot cognitive kernel
cd opencog/inferno-kernel
mk all && mk boot

# Run self-aware example
mk run-selfaware

# Run distributed mind example
mk run-distributed

# Python bridge demo
python3 opencog/inferno-kernel/lib/inferno_bridge.py
```

### Python Integration

```python
from opencog.inferno_kernel.lib.inferno_bridge import (
    InfernoKernelBridge, TruthValue
)

# Initialize kernel
kernel = InfernoKernelBridge()
kernel.init()

# Create knowledge
tv = TruthValue(0.9, 0.8)
atom = kernel.create_atom("consciousness", tv)

# Reasoning
inferences = kernel.deduce([atom1, atom2])

# Thinking
thought = kernel.think("what am I?")
```

See `opencog/inferno-kernel/README.md` for complete documentation.

## Multi-Agent Reasoning System

OpenCog includes the **Multi-Agent Orchestration Workbench** with:

### Key Components

1. **Agent-Zero (Master Builder)**
   - Orchestrates cognitive architectures for reasoning challenges
   - Coordinates 5 specialized agents (Analyzer, Strategist, Executor, Validator, Learner)
   - Adapts strategies based on task requirements

2. **Pattern Language Library**
   - 10 foundational cognitive patterns for AGI
   - Quality evolution: Experimental → Proven → Mature → Foundational
   - Pattern composition and relationships
   - Inspired by Christopher Alexander's "A Pattern Language"

3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Collaborative, competitive, and sequential orchestration modes
   - Message-based inter-agent communication
   - Load balancing and capability matching

4. **Strategy Repository**
   - 7 core reasoning strategies (Deductive, Inductive, Abductive, etc.)
   - Hybrid strategy composition
   - Performance tracking and adaptation

5. **Reasoning Tasks**
   - 95 comprehensive LLM reasoning challenges
   - Categories include logic, analogical reasoning, causal analysis, and more

### Quick Start

```python
from opencog import OpenCogWorkbench

# Initialize the workbench
workbench = OpenCogWorkbench(tasks_dir="opencog/reasoning-tasks")

# Get task statistics
stats = workbench.get_statistics()
print(stats)

# Solve a task autonomously
result = workbench.solve_task("analogical-problem-solving", 
                             orchestration_mode="autonomous")
print(result)

# Get recommendations for a task
recommendations = workbench.get_task_recommendations("deductive-logic-puzzles")
print(recommendations)
```

### Command-Line Tools

```bash
# Run the reasoning demo
python3 opencog/opencog_reasoning_demo.py

# Analyze reasoning tasks
opencog/bin/opencog-reasoning

# Solve a specific task with Agent-Zero
opencog/bin/opencog-agent-zero analogical-problem-solving autonomous
```

### Foundational Cognitive Patterns

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Break complex problems into manageable parts
2. **Recursive Thinking** - Apply problem-solving recursively
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify and match patterns
4. **Logical Inference** - Apply logical rules systematically
5. **Abstraction** - Extract general principles from specifics
6. **Working Backward** - Start from goal and work backward
7. **Metacognitive Monitoring** - Monitor and adjust approach
8. **Analogical Transfer** - Apply solutions from similar problems
9. **Constraint Satisfaction** - Satisfy multiple constraints
10. **Causal Reasoning** - Understand cause-effect relationships

## Language Capability Analysis

## Concept

Every programming language ever conceived is represented in RosettaCog through the specific functions that language was designed to express. OpenCog evaluates these implementations across multiple dimensions to create a "frankencog patchwork inference fabric" - an optimal combination of the best language-specific implementations for each cognitive function.

## Architecture

The OpenCog framework consists of several components:

1. **Language Capability Analyzer**: Evaluates the expressiveness and efficiency of each language for specific cognitive tasks
2. **AI Task Categorizer**: Classifies RosettaCode tasks into AI/cognitive computing categories
3. **Benchmarking Engine**: Measures performance, readability, and maintainability metrics
4. **Integration Manifest Generator**: Creates the "patchwork quilt" specification showing which language to use for each AI function

## AI/AGI Functional Categories

OpenCog categorizes tasks into the following AI domains:

- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Logic, theorem proving, constraint satisfaction
- **Pattern Recognition**: Search, matching, classification
- **Knowledge Representation**: Data structures, graphs, semantic networks
- **Machine Learning**: Statistical methods, optimization, neural networks
- **Natural Language Processing**: String manipulation, parsing, text analysis
- **Planning & Problem Solving**: Heuristic search, game playing, puzzle solving
- **Uncertainty Reasoning**: Probabilistic methods, fuzzy logic
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Concurrent systems, distributed computing, agent systems

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze all languages and generate evaluation report
./opencog/bin/opencog-analyze

# Generate the frankencog integration manifest
./opencog/bin/opencog-manifest

# Evaluate a specific language
./opencog/bin/opencog-eval-lang Python

# Evaluate a specific AI category
./opencog/bin/opencog-eval-category "Symbolic Reasoning"
```

## Output

The framework generates:
- Language capability profiles
- AI task categorization maps
- Performance benchmarks
- The FrankenCog Integration Manifest (optimal language selection for each function)
- Transcendent expression reports

## Philosophy

OpenCog represents the culmination of evaluating every known programming language against the full spectrum of AI capabilities. Through systematic benchmarking and optimization, we identify the most effective implementation for each cognitive function, creating a post-polyglot synthesis where each language's unique strengths are leveraged for the specific functions it was conceived to express.
